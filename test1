Peter took his medication in the morning and staff also noticed Peter suffering from allergies. Peter's mom took us to Kingstown Giant shopping center to purchase medicines for Peter. drove back home and Peter did his vacuuming and mopping of the house.
Dont let the anyone tell what to do when doing the right thing.
